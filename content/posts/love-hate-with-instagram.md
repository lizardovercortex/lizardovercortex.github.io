## The Love
While I was watching reels, I realized a few things. The emotions that got triggered inside me, I explored them.

1. Dr. Manhattan - Seeing Dr. Manhattan in a reel, being at peace and calm, all-powerful, and all-knowing. Your thoughts are not your voice; you are an observer of them.
2. [Zoro’s Wedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYsi7NQJ-MI) - Seeing all anime Idol men: Naruto, Sanji, Rengoku, Sasuke, Vegita, Satoru, and Zoro. All are wearing suits. It made me notice that a good suit on a good physique looks very good. And I became sad for not having one. I then thought that I should get a good physique, I should workout.

## The HATE
Instagram takes you through a range of emotions in a very short span of time. Like -

- Guilt
- Missing someone
- Bravery
- Main character energy
- Laughter
- Pain
- Arousal

Everything in 5-10 minutes, releasing a heavy cocktail of chemicals in the brain. All these chemicals were meant to be released while doing meaningful things, not everything at once.

I feel this cocktail release is very unnatural for us. Maybe that’s why scrolling Instagram is so addictive; the brain likes it so much.
