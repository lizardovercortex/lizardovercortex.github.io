I need to change myself, I have replaced the emptiness in my life with fake validations and fake happiness.  
Being cheery all the time, making people laugh, laughing myself cheek to cheek, caring for everyone's feelings and emotions and restricting myself because of it.  
Responding to everyone quickly, and all messages.  
Responding in sarcastic way to make stuff fun, just doing chatter chatter and blabbering on chat in-person.

### You need to stop all this, eliminate all these traits from yourself.

- Depression was not there in stone age (not sure, but feels good to believe, because they were just always trying to survive)
or with spartans. They were always busy working for something and on themselves and their body, they had not time to think
about useless depression stuff. But look at current lifestyle, you can spend your morning to evening doing nothing but sitting 
in front of a screen. We need to become stronger, I need to become stronger.  
- See the calmness of a shaolin monk, they are fit in mind and body. Because of ZEN maybe (vast topic but ZEN is when you hammer your mind and body to practice same stuff again and again, don't think just practice, ZEN = FLOW STATE.)
- Toji Zeni'n physique, I would love to have it, seriously and anime physique is a tough goal but boy it does look goood-est.
- Reflect who you are / were? Don't fake, even if it feels natural separate the fakeness and be you. Your identity enforces your habits, and your habits might change your identity, which you may identify as YOU, but it's fake.
Like bad habits can create a bad identity of yourself in your own subconscious and brain, and it'll get reinforced due to bad habits, and you'll think that I'm like this only. 
But that's not you, identity can be changed, maintain neutral good habits and you'll discover yourself, the true YOU, what you want to be truly.
