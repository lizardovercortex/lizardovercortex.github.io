1. Sōsuke Aizen - Lies, but is more powerful than anyone else, he hides but does whatever he wants, with no fear of anyone. Except kisuke?

2. Kisuke Urahara - He was calm and chill, was at peace, and he was doing research as he liked on whatever he wanted, he is very powerful and does illegal research too.  

█████ (redacted name of my ex) took plunge when she switched her careers from Dental to Psychology.
Like my state is now, her's was then; In a major dilemma, confused, scared of the life ahead. 
She seems happy now, after changing things, after leaving me.  
I want to reject all restraints and be free, and do whatever I want to and not want to do. 
To do something / not do something and then keep it in my brain with second thoughts or fear or anxiety.
Like - Eat non veg, drink beer, workout and get fit, leave this job, learn new stuff.  
I want to feel like Kisuke, he knows his stuff, he loved and was good at what he did and he was fluid, free, light weight, lean body, fit in the mind and body.
Think about if you had a lot of money already what would you do?  

Fuck it man, first of all please remove this obesity, I want to get freedom from this and the parasitic load it has on my brain.  

---  
That freedom you talked about - to be fit, free, and learn new stuff.
Irony is that this freedom which feels good, is a result of not-so-free discipline rigorously followed, daily, again and again.  
Only if you achieve your goals daily, by doing the boring and repetitive stuff again and again.  
Like working out, your mind will be free from the stress of getting fit.  
You won't be crying about that like -  man I should probably do that thing for my own good.  
You know what to do, but not doing it creates mental load that you should do it to make your life better.  
Only if you do it, you'll feel free to do other stuff.  
So, you can get freedom by being disciplined and boring. And not by being totally free and doing whatever the fuck you want 
(In this age of digital poisoning, you brain will only run towards TikToks and Reels and all that shit, caging you in) and destroying your freedom.  
> True freedom will put shackles on your Brain.
